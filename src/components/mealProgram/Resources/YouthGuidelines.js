        At Community Kitchens, our youth program is guided by the same
        principles that shape our other meal programs. Our meals are used to
        fill gaps left by other food support programs, to promote healthy
        lifestyles and connection to community, and to provide security and
        dignity for marginalized communities. We want to give our kids a healthy
        meal to help them to focus on learning and playing while they grow.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        CK youth meal programs serve "Lunch Box Style" meals to children in
        sports camps, after school programs, elementary and middle schools and
        are intended to be eaten on site. Other youth meal programs provide
        cold, "Take Away" meals to be reheated. Please confirm with the CK Meal
        Program Manager what type of meals you are providing.
      </p>
      <h2>Meal Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Our primary guideline is that meals prepared should be of equal
          quality to meals sold in your restaurant and are meals that you would
          be proud to serve your own family, friends and customers
        </li>
        <li>Offer wholesome meals that are healthy and nutritious</li>
        <li>Decide 2-4 meals you can rotate</li>
        <li>
          As a general guideline, meals should be 14-16 oz in total weight and
          be broken down into:
          <ul>
            <li>6 oz protein</li>
            <li>4 oz starch or grain</li>
            <li>4 oz vegetables</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>No use of tree nuts, peanuts, and shellfish</li>
      </ul>
